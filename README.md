# CasaOS Management Tool

This Python script provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing CasaOS installations. It supports updating CasaOS, resetting the username and password by backing up and managing the `user.db` file, and completely reinstalling CasaOS.

## Features

- **Update CasaOS**: Downloads and installs the latest updates for CasaOS.
- **Reset Username and Password**: Backs up the current `user.db` and restarts the relevant service to apply changes.
- **Reinstall CasaOS**: Uninstalls and reinstalls CasaOS, ideal for starting fresh or troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CasaOS installed on the machine
- Administrative or sudo privileges

## Installation

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

2. Download the script to your preferred directory:
    ```bash
    wget [URL to script] -O casaos_manager.py
    ```

3. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x casaos_manager.py
    ```

## Usage

Run the script with one of the following commands based on the action you want to perform. You must run these commands as a user with sudo privileges.

```bash
./casaos_manager.py update       # Updates CasaOS
./casaos_manager.py reset        # Resets username and password
./casaos_manager.py reinstall    # Reinstalls CasaOS
```

### Optional: Running with Python directly

If you prefer, you can also run the script directly with Python:

```bash
python3 casaos_manager.py update
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script.
- Check that Python 3 is correctly installed and configured on your PATH.
- If you encounter issues with the script interpreting commands, ensure the shebang line at the top of the script is set to `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
